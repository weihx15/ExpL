# ExpL

ExpL (Expression Language) is a simple expression evaluation language designed for basic mathematical operations and variable handling. ExpL features concise syntax and a small number of keywords, suitable for rapid expression calculation and outputting results.

## Language Rules

-   **Keywords:** `output`
-   **Identifiers:** Alphanumeric, starting with a letter
-   **Numbers:** Support integers and decimals
-   **Symbols:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`, `(`, `)`, `;`

ExpL language does not differentiate between data types and uniformly uses floating-point numbers for processing. It supports only basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, without complex relational or logical operators. ExpL language consists only of assignment statements and output statements, without complex branching or looping structures.
